Descriptive statistics can be used to describe the features of a dataset, such as the mean, median, mode, range, standard deviation, frequency distribution, etc. For example, descriptive statistics can be used to report the average age, income, and education level of a sample of voters in an election.\n",

    "Inferential statistics uses the data from a sample to make predictions or generalizations about a population. Inferential statistics can be used to test hypotheses, estimate parameters, compare groups, or assess relationships among variables. For example, inferential statistics can be used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the mean test scores of two groups of students who received different teaching methods."

Discrete data are data that can only take certain values, such as whole numbers or categories. Continuous data are data that can take any value within a range, such as fractions or decimals. For example, quantitative data can be the number of books sold by a bookstore (discrete) or the weight of a person(continuous).\n",

For example, qualitative data can be the gender of a person (nominal) or the satisfaction level of a customer(ordinal)."

An example of ordinal data is a ranking system for a competition. Interval data is used to measure variables with a specific unit of measurement.
